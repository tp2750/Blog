Running needs to be able to handle continuously changing tone for the same now depending on context.

Use case: play in just intonation:
(c,e,g), (g,c,e): in piano: keep c,  e the same, move G down an octave. In just intonation, c and e change frequencies.
I want this change of c, e to happen without triggering a new note, so no new envelope.

The difference: keep same time or change time could be indicated with a slur in the score.
How is this represented in data frame?
Note also needs to include slur start.
Or is slur an envelope?
Alternative to envelope: transition funktion changing frequency from a to b by matching phase!
We can only March phase when we know the tempo and running as those determine the phase at the transition to the next note.

So akut means match phase.

Input to rendering is a score: set of voices.
Use the simple inversion in just intonation as fishing example.
Try do this as simple is possible.
Then build up from there.

Keep in mind for this could be driven by Linnstrument: .

So controls: bend, changing instrument parameters while now is held.
Always maxi the phase!

Check midi pme. At some point learn from midi2,0, but start by developing own ideas to understand challenges.

In the case (c,e,g),(g,c,e) the key determine if it so c or g that stays in time ( constant in octave space).

Next example is alternating triads C, G, C . Explore inversions and keys. Ask in just intonation.

A time signal is used for reng√∏ring.
A temp generates a time signal.
If a note is 2 beat it runs for 4 times as long as 1/2 beat.

Name: Music Synthesis functions.

Instrument includes running and envelope.
Even with envelope apply the phase match.

Given notes, running,  tempo, compute phase at each note boundary. This is independent of the time generating function ( sine,  saw, square). How about unsymmetrical tones?
The issue is where in the cycle to start to the shape of the single cycle does not matter.
We can draw a single pulse and use that as unit in a periodic function.
That is also an instrument.
Keep it instrument agnostic

The phase depends on the frequency and duration, so we need note (pitch, duration), running, tempo.

Pulse: 1 periodic function used to generate sound. The derivative should also be periodic.
